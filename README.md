# mhei's EVerest modules

## Introduction

This repository contains several [EVerest](https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core) modules
which I developed while playing or testing with EVerest.

# Releases and Versioning

Similar to EVerest, a date-based versioning is used. The aim is to have releases with corresponding
versions that are compatible with the upstream EVerest releases.

Note, that this means that there might be a delay after a new upstream EVerest release is tagged.

And a small note: the second version number has a leading zero here so that it sorts better.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Tag       | EVerest release              |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 2024.09.0 | 2024.9.0 or newer[^or_newer] |

[^or_newer]: Newer releases or upstream's `main` branch may already contain incompatible changes.
             The compatibility matrix will be updated with each new tag in this repository.
